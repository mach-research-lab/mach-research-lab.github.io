<h2>Postdoctoral Position — Quantum Circuit Simulation</h2>

<p><strong>We are seeking a postdoc</strong> to co-design efficient and realistic simulation algorithms for noisy quantum circuits in superconducting hardware, combining quantum modeling with hardware-aware performance engineering. The work involves simulations for quantum error correction and mid-circuit operations, and will require both low-level optimization skills (e.g., SIMD, GPU, FPGA) and an understanding of quantum simulation trade-offs. The role supports integration with a 25-qubit chip and involves close collaboration with physicists and engineers to push the boundaries of scalable, high-fidelity quantum simulations.</p>

<h3>Information about the project</h3>
<p>This project is part of <strong>QuantumStack</strong>, a 5-year project funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, aiming to develop a full software stack for programming quantum computers. The project is integrated with the <strong>Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology (WACQT)</strong>, a 12-year, billion-SEK initiative started in 2018 to advance Swedish academia and industry to the forefront of quantum technology and build a Swedish quantum computer.</p>
<p>Our goal at Chalmers is to build this quantum computer with 100 superconducting qubits and apply it to computationally hard problems in optimization, quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning.</p>

<p>Building such a system requires a multidisciplinary effort involving physicists, engineers, computer scientists, and materials researchers. The person taking this position will work mainly with the <strong>Computer Science and Engineering Department</strong> team on performance engineering and hardware-aware code optimizations for scalable simulation systems, in close collaboration with the physics team for algorithmic-level co-design.</p>

<p>We are seeking candidates with backgrounds in performance engineering and high-performance computing (HPC) hardware (CPUs, GPUs), and/or modeling of quantum computer systems. This could be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A PhD in Computer Science or Engineering (computer architecture/HPC topics) with knowledge of quantum computing, or</li>
  <li>A PhD in Physics (quantum computing focus) with knowledge of HPC systems and performance engineering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information about the division and department</h3>
<p>The project runs within the <strong>Division of Computer Networks and Systems</strong> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers. The division has four faculty members, four postdocs, and eleven PhD students focusing on computer architecture, with funding from national and EU projects. Faculty members have received prestigious grants (including ERC Advanced Grant) and participate in EU initiatives like the <em>European Processor Initiative (EPI)</em> and EuroHPC projects.</p>

<p>International students rate Chalmers highly for education quality. The university offers MSc programs in <em>High-Performance Computer Systems</em> and <em>Data Science</em>, aligning closely with this postdoc’s research area.</p>

<h3>Major responsibilities</h3>
<p>Your main responsibility is to develop efficient simulation algorithms for quantum computers, involving analytical and numerical work and optimization for advanced hardware. You may also supervise PhD or master’s students working on related topics.</p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Physics, or related field (before employment)</li>
  <li>Excellent English communication skills</li>
  <li>Programming experience in Python and C/C++</li>
  <li>Knowledge of GPU programming</li>
  <li>Experience with performance profiling</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Desired qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Experience with quantum computing</li>
  <li>Experience with FPGA development</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contract terms</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>full-time, two-year temporary postdoctoral position</strong>.</p>

<h3>We offer</h3>
<p>Chalmers provides an inspiring work environment in Gothenburg, with extensive benefits for employees. The university actively works to improve gender balance and supports equality through initiatives such as the <strong>GENIE Initiative</strong>.</p>

<h3>Application procedure</h3>
<p>The application should be written in English and attached as PDF files (max 40 MB each; Zip files not supported):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CV</strong> — include full publication list, teaching experience, and two references.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal letter</strong> — 1–3 pages introducing yourself, summarizing past research, and outlining future goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Other documents</strong> — verified copies of degrees, grades, and certificates.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> November 2, 2025.<br>
Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis; the position may be filled before the deadline.</p>
